# MayMay39

**Hai!** I'm a programmer and I've just started my game development journey with my **ABYSS** series. It's a retro game franchise about a world seperated in half by a god. You can play the first game for free at https://maymay39.itch.io/abyssrush.

## Interests

I'm obsessed with the Color Graphics Adapter Palette. Have a look:

Glorious, right? My **ABYSS** series uses this palette to celebrate CGA's 40th anniversary (It came out in 1981!) and also because I simply enjoy it.

I'm a fanatic of other retro palettes such as gameboy but palettes are boring so let's move on.

I'm a rhythm game god, but not a good rhythm game programmer. I hope I can learn how to develop rhythm games in the future, for now I'm stuck with bullet hells, platformers, and shoot 'em ups.

My favorite food is Watermelon but I can't stand tomatoes.

My personal favorite music artist is Calum Bowen.

I enjoy a nice cup of Pink Starburst drink mix every once in a while.

## How I Program

This is embarrassing to say, but I don't *actually* know exactly how to program. I use an edited version of the **Scratch editor**, an HTML5 based program. I'll get to learning C# and JavaScript for Unity and website programming when I stop being lazy, haha.

Anyways, programming is a pastime for me. I make game assets either in the Scratch editor or with https://piskelapp.com, I grab sound effects from https://ZapSplat.com or generate them with https://sfxr.me, and the music used in my games are the soundtrack for other awesome games that inspired me to become a game dev. Of course, I don't steal them - full credit is given.
