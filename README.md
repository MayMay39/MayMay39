# MayMay39

**Hai!** I'm a programmer and I've just started my game development journey with my **ABYSS** series. It's a retro game franchise about a world seperated in half by a god. You can play the first game for free at https://maymay39.itch.io/abyssrush.

##### First game released November 17th 2019

## Interests

I'm obsessed with the Color Graphics Adapter Palette, here's what it looks like:

I like other retro palettes but I'm kinda biased towards CGA because I use it in the **ABYSS** series.

Anyways, I enjoy Watermelon but I absolutely can't stand tomatoes. I enjoy a cup of Pink Starburst drink mix every once in a while.

I'm a rhythm game fanatic but I can't program them, I can only really do bullet hells, shoot 'em ups, and platformers.
## How I Program

This is embarrassing to say, but I don't *actually* know exactly how to program. I use an edited version of the **Scratch editor**, an HTML5 based program. I'll get to learning C# and JavaScript for Unity and website programming when I stop being lazy, haha.

Anyways, programming is a pastime for me. I make game assets either in the Scratch editor or with https://piskelapp.com, I grab sound effects from https://ZapSplat.com or generate them with https://sfxr.me, and the music used in my games are the soundtrack for other awesome games that inspired me to become a game dev. Of course, I don't steal them - full credit is given.
